# Airbnb Clone â€“ Backend Requirements Specification

## Objective
To define and document the key technical, functional, and non-functional requirements necessary to develop a scalable, secure, and robust backend for an Airbnb Clone application.

## Introduction
The backend of the Airbnb Clone powers all server-side functionality including user management, property listings, booking logic, payments, notifications, and admin control. This document outlines all required components to ensure the system is efficient, maintainable, and production-ready.

## Core Functionalities

### 1. User Management

#### User Registration
- Users can register as guests or hosts.
- JWT-based secure authentication.

#### Login & Authentication
- Login with email and password.
- Optional OAuth integration (Google, Facebook).

#### Profile Management
- Users can update their profile including:
  - Name, contact details
  - Profile picture (file upload)
  - Hosting/guest preferences

### 2. Property Listings Management

#### Add Listings
- Hosts can create listings with:
  - Title, description
  - Location (city, country)
  - Price per night
  - Amenities (e.g., Wi-Fi, pool)
  - Images
  - Availability dates

#### Edit/Delete Listings
- Hosts can update or delete their listings.

### 3. Search and Filtering

#### Property Discovery
- Search properties by:
  - Location
  - Price range
  - Number of guests
  - Amenities

#### Pagination
- Results are paginated for performance optimization.

### 4. Booking Management

#### Create Booking
- Guests can book a property for available dates.
- Validation to prevent overlapping/double bookings.

#### Cancel Booking
- Guests or hosts can cancel a booking.
- Cancellations follow predefined policy rules.

#### Booking Status
- Track bookings: pending, confirmed, cancelled, completed.

### 5. Payment Integration

#### Guest Payments
- Secure payments via Stripe or PayPal.
- Payments are processed at the time of booking.

#### Host Payouts
- Hosts are automatically paid after booking completion.

#### Currency Support
- Support for multiple currencies.

### 6. Reviews and Ratings

- Guests can review and rate properties.
- Hosts can respond to reviews.
- Each review must be linked to a valid booking.

### 7. Notifications System

- Email and in-app notifications for:
  - Booking confirmations and cancellations
  - Payment updates
  - Admin notices

### 8. Admin Dashboard

- Admins can:
  - View and manage users (guests and hosts)
  - Review and moderate listings
  - View booking statuses
  - Monitor payments and disputes

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Database Management

- Relational DBMS: PostgreSQL or MySQL
- Tables:
  - Users
  - Listings (Properties)
  - Bookings
  - Payments
  - Reviews
  - Notifications

### 2. API Development

- RESTful API design
  - GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, DELETE
  - Consistent status codes (200, 201, 400, 401, 403, 404, 500)

- GraphQL (Optional)
  - Used for complex or nested data fetching

### 3. Authentication and Authorization

- Use JWT for user sessions
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
  - Guest
  - Host
  - Admin

### 4. File Storage

- Store images (profile photos, listing photos)
- Use local file storage or integrate AWS S3/Cloudinary
  - For MVP: implement local storage

### 5. Third-Party Services

- Email: Use SendGrid or Mailgun for notifications
- Payment: Stripe or PayPal API

### 6. Error Handling and Logging

- Centralized error handler
- Logging mechanism for:
  - Failed payments
  - Invalid logins
  - System errors

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Scalability

- Modular architecture (services/controllers/models)
- Horizontal scaling via load balancers and containerization (Docker/Kubernetes ready)

### 2. Security

- Passwords hashed with bcrypt or Argon2
- HTTPS enforced
- Input validation to prevent:
  - SQL injection
  - XSS/CSRF attacks
- Rate limiting and firewall setup

### 3. Performance Optimization

- Use Redis for:
  - Caching search results
  - Session management (optional)

- Optimize database indexing and queries

### 4. Testing

- Unit tests (e.g., pytest, unittest)
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Automated CI test suite
